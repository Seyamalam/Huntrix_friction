To ground the comparisons in hands-on data, both tools are tested using the same prompt throughout this tutorial:

Prompt

Build a CLI-based mini to-do application in Python. It should allow users to create tasks, mark tasks as completed, list tasks with filtering for completed and pending tasks, delete tasks, include error handling, persist tasks to a local JSON file, and include basic unit tests.

For a fair comparison, Gemini CLI is tested on its free tier using Gemini 3 Flash Preview, which is the default model the free tier provides access to. Claude Code is tested on the Pro plan using Claude Sonnet 4.6, which is the model Claude Code primarily uses for everyday interactions on that plan.

Each tool will run this prompt three times. Completion time, token usage, and the quality of the generated code are recorded from the runs and are referenced in the Performance, Code Quality, and Usage Cost sections of this tutorial.

The table below provides more detailed metrics to help with each comparison:

The following sections explore each metric in detail, so you can decide which tool fits your workflow best.

When writing Python programs, it helps to be able to comfortably use your tools without dealing with unintuitive interfaces. Both Gemini CLI and Claude Code prioritize a smooth terminal experience, but user experience goes beyond the interface itself—installation, setup, available models, and features offered are also part of it.

A few differences exist between Gemini CLI and Claude Code during installation. Gemini CLI requires a Google account for authentication. Claude Code doesn’t need a Google account. Instead, it requires an Anthropic subscription or API key.

Gemini CLI is first installed using npm:

You can also install Gemini CLI with Anaconda, MacPorts, or Homebrew, which you can find in the Gemini CLI documentation.

When installing Claude Code, you run the following commands:

You’ll find more information on installation in the Claude Code documentation.

Both installation processes are similar. However, Windows users must install Git for Windows before installing Claude Code. No such restrictions exist for Gemini CLI.

The differences become more apparent during registration. Gemini CLI offers a free tier, while Claude Code requires payment to get started through either a paid subscription or prepaid API credits.

Therefore, if budget constraints are a concern, Gemini CLI may be a preferred choice. To authenticate with Gemini CLI, you’ll log in with your Google account:

For this tutorial and for everyday use, you can select the first option and log in using an existing Google account.

After installation, setup, and registration, you can run both tools. To start Gemini CLI, change to a project directory and run the following command in the terminal:

For Claude Code, change to a project directory and run:

In both cases, a welcome screen will appear ready to accept your prompts.

Note: Both Claude Code and Gemini CLI will warn you about running them in the home directory. To be safe, change into a different directory and run the tools.

Both Gemini and Claude offer a range of models that vary in capability and are tied to different subscription tiers.

On the Gemini side, you have access to these models:

Claude’s lineup includes:

The right model for you is dependent on the nature of your task. To handle day-to-day tasks in your Python development workflow, a lighter model will be just fine. For complex refactoring or implementing a feature across multiple files, the heavier models are worth the cost.

Both tools also offer a set of features that go beyond code generation and are worth knowing about as you use them day to day.
Gemini CLI supports slash commands like:

These commands help manage your session. Claude Code similarly supports slash commands like:

It also supports a CLAUDE.md file where you can define project-specific rules and instructions that persist across sessions.

Given the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs), objectively measuring performance based on a single prompt or a small set of coding tasks is unreliable. For that reason, this section draws from SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark designed to measure how well LLMs handle real-world software engineering tasks. The benchmark tests whether models can fix real GitHub issues from open-source repositories. Epoch AI tracks the results.

To complement that data, the to-do app prompt is also run three times on each tool, in clean terminal environments, and the average completion time, lines of code, and tests passed are recorded:

Based on the recorded data, you’ll see that Claude Code completes the tasks significantly faster than Gemini CLI in an average of the three runs.

You’ll also notice from the average total lines of code generated that Claude Code has significantly more lines, which may suggest that it considers more edge cases, generating more production-quality code and handling errors robustly.

Based on Epoch AI’s SWE-bench Verified scores, Gemini 3 Flash achieved an accuracy of 75.4% as of March 21, 2026. This is a significant number, particularly for a model that is available on a free tier, generally used for everyday Python tasks like generating boilerplate, debugging common errors, and writing unit tests. This number shows that the tool is useful and reliable most of the time.

In hands-on testing, Gemini CLI completed the to-do app prompt in an average of 2 minutes and 36.3 seconds across the three runs. The output was generated iteratively, and the final result was usable with all tests passing successfully.

The Claude Sonnet 4.6 model achieved 75.2% accuracy on March 21, 2026 on the same SWE-bench report, which is a bit lower than Gemini 3 Flash.

In hands-on testing, Claude Code completed the same to-do app prompt in an average of 1 minute and 44.7 seconds across the three runs, which was an impressive performance over Gemini CLI for the same task. The generated code worked correctly, with all tests passing.

As the chart below shows, Epoch’s SWE-bench results suggest that Gemini CLI edges out Claude Code slightly in accuracy. However, whether this indicates an overall higher performance of Gemini CLI over Claude Code is difficult to determine.

Given the probabilistic nature of LLMs, the gap could shift with any new evaluation. What the numbers do suggest is that Gemini’s free tier model holds up strongly against Claude’s paid-tier model on real-world software engineering tasks:

Epoch AI’s report of the SWE-bench Verified benchmark measures model accuracy on real-world software engineering tasks, specifically, the percentage of GitHub issues a model successfully fixes. Results are human-validated, making it a meaningful source of information in coding-focused AI comparisons.

Based on benchmark results and hands-on testing, both models are nearly tied in accuracy, with Gemini 3 Flash exceeding Claude Sonnet 4.6 by 0.2 percent on the leaderboard. However, Claude Code generates code faster, despite generating more lines of code.

This comparison is based on the specific models analyzed here. For all models considered in the same benchmark results, Claude Opus 4.6 towers over Gemini models at the time of writing.

Performance metrics give a reliable overview of each tool, but code quality is what developers live with day to day, and they tend to be quite sensitive to it. A model that resolves issues but produces unreadable code that is hard to maintain isn’t doing you many favors in the long run and could add to frustrations.

The to-do app code generated by both tools was examined in light of guidelines written in a Real Python tutorial on Python code quality.

Gemini CLI generally produces clean, functional Python code that follows common conventions. For standard tasks such as creating classes, writing functions, and generating data transformation logic, the output is usable.

For the to-do app it created all required functionality. The resulting app allows you to add tasks, view all tasks, view tasks with filters for pending and completed tasks, delete tasks, complete tasks, and persist them, all with error handling.

The code was generally readable, with Pythonic naming practices according to PEP 8 conventions. The collapsibles below show each file generated in the first run using Gemini 3 Flash Preview:

The CLI methods and library methods were placed in the same file, making the code less readable and less modular. Three files were generated, including a test file and a JSON file to help persist data. The directory tree below will help clarify the file structure:

The methods were appropriately named, making it easy to figure out what each method did, but there was a lack of documentation to aid understanding. Well-structured documentation is essential for high-quality code.

In the second run for Gemini 3 Flash Preview, there was an improvement in documentation. Each method in most files was accompanied by appropriate documentation.

However, unlike the first run, where CLI methods weren’t separated from library methods, both were placed in different files, improving readability and modularity. As many as six files were generated, including a test file.

Unlike the first and second runs, the third run consisted of a multi-directory structure. Its documentation also wasn’t as thorough as the second run’s. There were a total of eight files generated:

It’s interesting that despite being generated by the same model and within the same hour, the code generated differed in subtle ways in all three runs, varying in file structure and documentation.

You can therefore conclude that Gemini CLI is quite adept at generating code of good quality. In all three runs, the code was readable, reusable, maintainable, and compliant with PEP standards. While it lacks consistency in documentation, file structure, and a few other features, the code produced is usable with some user involvement.

Claude Code produces clean, well-structured Python code. It’s quite convenient to add code generated by Claude Code into an existing codebase without too much modification. For the to-do app project, Claude Sonnet 4.6 generated three files in the first run:

Documentation was available for the methods generated. The directory structure for the generated project:

Claude Code added a created_at field unprompted, attesting to its autonomous behavior.

In the second run, documentation for the code wasn’t as thorough as in the first and two files were generated as opposed to three in the first run.

The third run generated code that was similar to the first, followed Python coding standards (PEP 8), was readable, reusable, maintainable, and documented.

Both tools showed variability across runs, differing in file structure, documentation, and complexity. This points to a fact regarding LLM-generated code: consistency isn’t guaranteed, and some level of review is required no matter what tools you use. The table below shows some code quality differences between them for a side-by-side comparison:

Claude Code had an edge over Gemini CLI in modularity, docstrings, error handling, readability, type hints, and other features, as seen in the table. Its style was also more consistent, with type hints and double quotes throughout with a few long lines. Gemini CLI, however, was inconsistent with quotes, using single quotes in some areas and double in others. Some files also lacked type hints.

While both tools produced code of generally good quality, Claude Code surpassed Gemini CLI in producing code that was more production-ready.

Cost is often a deciding factor, especially for solo developers and smaller teams working within tight budgets. Both tools differ significantly in how they approach pricing. Understanding these differences can save you from unexpected charges or unnecessary restrictions.

Gemini CLI has a clear advantage when it comes to cost. It offers a free tier. With a personal Google account, you get access to models like Gemini 3 Flash Preview at no cost up to a set daily usage limit, which for most individual developers is generous enough to get some meaningful work done in the day.

Running the to-do app prompt three times, the average completion time was 2 minutes and 36.3 seconds. As you may have guessed, Gemini CLI’s free tier doesn’t charge for usage. Average input tokens were recorded as 44,640, and average output tokens were 3,771.7. At standard API pricing using the Gemini Flash Preview model, that works out to roughly $0.03 per run. However, under the free tier, those runs cost nothing at all.

To view token usage at the end of a session, just type /exit in the prompt, and you’ll see a snapshot of your usage metrics similar to the one below:

For heavier usage beyond the free tier limits, Gemini CLI shifts to paid plans through Google AI Studio or the Gemini API, where pricing is based on input and output tokens. Developers working on larger projects or running the tool frequently across a team may eventually resort to paid plans.

Claude Code requires a paid Anthropic subscription before you can get started, so unlike Gemini CLI, it has no free plans. As of 2026, the Pro plan starts at $20 per month and gives you access to Claude Sonnet 4.6 for most interactions, with Claude Opus 4.6 available for more complex tasks depending on your usage limits.

Running the same to-do app prompt three times, the average completion time was 1 minute and 44.7 seconds, using an average total of 8,833.3 message tokens. Claude Code abstracts token usage and provides a total average of tokens consumed on the Pro plan. Developers who want a breakdown of input and output tokens will find Gemini CLI’s detailed token breakdown more useful for tracking and optimizing usage.

For developers accessing Claude Sonnet 4.6 through the API instead, standard pricing is $3.00 per million input tokens and $15.00 per million output tokens, making it more expensive than Gemini 3 Flash at the API level. However, its subscription model makes this less significant for most developers.

A direct cost comparison between both tools is a bit complicated because you may work more efficiently on a paid Claude Code plan than on Gemini CLI’s free tier for the same number of tokens. However, for developers who are just getting started with AI-assisted coding, the mandatory subscription is sometimes a point of concern.

Both tools are genuinely useful for Python development, and the best choice depends on your specific situation:

For developers just starting out with AI-assisted coding, Gemini CLI is a likely entry point. The free tier lets you experiment without financial commitment, and it covers a wide range of common Python tasks well. If you find yourself hitting its limits, particularly around project complexity, you can choose to switch to its paid plans or to Claude Code.

One challenge in comparing these tools directly is that they report usage data very differently. Gemini CLI provides detailed per-session data including input tokens, output tokens, and tool calls at the end of every session. Claude Code on the Pro plan doesn’t expose this data at the end of a session. For developers who prefer detailed insights into how their AI tool is consuming resources, Gemini CLI appears to be more transparent.

You’ve compared two AI coding assistants for the terminal: Gemini CLI and Claude Code. With the help of a prompt and SWE-bench Verified benchmark data, you saw how they stack up in user experience, performance, code quality, and cost.
